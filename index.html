        <h1>My ordeal with the men I met online</h1>
        <p>My name is Dubem

            I met Ade on Facebook during my National youth service. He told me he works in one of the new generation banks and also lectures in one Polytechnic on weekends. He wanted me to visit him so that we could know ourselves better.
            
            I told Funke, my friend, because we lived in the same apartment. She was against me going to see him, she wondered why I should visit a man I have not seen before. She said that human beings are not usually what they seem to be online and that a precious look could be deceptive. She gave me reasons not to visit him.
            
            But I ignored her warnings. I made up my mind to go see the Ade. Well, I only told her because it won't be nice to just leave the house without letting her know.
            After all, I have done it before when I visited Obinna.
            
            I met Obinna online but on another chat platform.
            
            I traveled to Lagos for the first time to see Obinna.  I was in my first year at the university. I had to travel not after he sent me transportation fare. I hate to be like my friends; they know how to collect transport fares but will not show up. I keep to my words. So I visited Obinna. 
            
            My fear then was for him not to sleep with me and he ended up not sleeping with me.  Yes, Obinna didn’t sleep with me, unlike Austin, the other man I visited in my third year in University who almost got me raped.
              
            I remembered that faithful day.
            
            I met Austin at our university E-library; He was a handsome man from the depth of his eyes to the warm expression of his gentle voice, Very brilliant & smart. He came to do his Post-graduate studies. He also owned a media house outside school.  I got interested in him especially when I heard he was into media. It has always been my dream to work in the communication industry. We became friends and started hanging around often.
            
            One day he invited me to his friend’s birthday party, the party didn't end on time, I was worried; I had wanted to leave but didn't know my way back to my hostel. It became very late that the only option was to follow him to his house as he pleaded.
            
            We got to his house, a moderate apartment not exquisitely furnished as I had expected. He said I should feel at home.  He wanted me to take my bath to get ready for the night.  I made him know that the night would soon disappear so there won’t be a need for me to take my bath; it was just three hours to daybreak.
            
            He proceeded to the bathroom. When he came out he told me how refreshed he felt that he wondered why I refused to shower.
            
            We got ready for the night.
            
            He slept on the floor in his sitting room while I was on the couch. Some minutes after, he wanted me to sleep on the floor with him he said it was better to sleep on the floor than the couch, I refused.
            
            The next thing I saw Austin was on top of me, he pinned me down, he tried to force me. I pushed him and he fell from the couch.  This was the same man that promised not to have sex with me until I was fully ready.
            
            He said he doesn’t think he could keep to the promise again when the opportunity was right there in front of him.  He tried to force me again, I stopped him he said I should leave his house that night since I don't want him to have sex with him.
            
            And that was how I left Austin's house and ended up sleeping at their car park amidst the cold night and the fear of what might happen to me. I couldn't wait for the day to break as I hurriedly went back to my hostel the next morning.
            
            What I experienced with Austin I prayed not to have again. I made sure I bonded with Ade well before visiting him our communication brought us close. We were breathing in love or so I thought. That was how I rebuffed my friend’s advice and went to visit Ade in Ekiti state. I transported myself with the only cash I had. Ade told me to use my money that he would reimburse me when we see.
            
             I arrived at Ekiti, I called him to pick me up as I waited patiently, looking forward to seeing Ade my well-to-do banker. I practically checked all the saloon cars that passed to see my Ade because that was the type of vehicle he told me that he had. 
            
            I waited for God knows how long until I saw him. He smiled sheepishly at me, as he came down from the okada (Motorcycle). 
            We exchanged greetings; I wondered why he came with an okada when he told me he had a car. As if he read my mind, he immediately told me that he left his car with his mechanic. Meanwhile, he was still with his car keys that supposedly should be with his mechanic. Well, I minded myself and took the story the way it was being served.
            
            We got to his house, what I saw wasn't what I had wanted to see.  I kept my cool; after all, it was just for a day.
            
            Ade told me to feel at home that he needed to be in school for his 12-noon lecture. I was in his house which later became his friend's house till 7 pm waiting for him to come back. I felt hungry. I blamed myself for not eating first before embarking on such a journey.
            
            Not awhile, I was greeted by two able-bodied ruffled looking men and a lady.  I greeted them back with fear. They asked to know whom I came to see, I mentioned Ade. They all smiled cynically, I trembled the more, oh God what have I gotten myself into?
            
            It was at that moment that Ade entered, writhed of alcohol, he greeted his men loudly and told me to follow him to the next room. I quickly did as I was told, only to turn my back and saw his friends undressing me with their eyes.
            
            What I saw in the room he took me to made me flog myself the more for the wrong decision I made. I wanted to take my bath. He led me to a very filthy smeared bathroom. I told him not to bother; I'd rather not take my bath again. Thank God I was able to urinate amidst the nasty foul that almost pushed me out.
            
            We went back to the room, I implored him to get me something to eat as I had eaten nothing since he left me for his lectures and never bothered to ask if I was hungry.  He told me he could not get food anywhere unless I could take a soft drink with snacks. I accepted. I had no option; my intestine already had begun to tear into bits. He brought the drink and left to chat with his friends.
            
            I gulped the drink with relief. I later changed to my sleeping wear, ready to sleep. I dreaded sleeping on the same bed with him because he looked like the type of man that could give someone nightmares. The pictures he had sent to me online weren’t the same person I saw.
            
            He came in without wasting time he jumped on me, he began to caress my body. I tried to stop him. I told him that he shouldn't go there, that I don’t have sex on my first visit that my aim was just to see him. He was really surprised at what came out of my mouth. He tried again, I refused him.
            Immediately he pounced on me, slapped me, and tore my precious pink silky nightwear into shrewd. I screamed so that anyone around could hear me but all to no avail.  His friends were of course in support of what was happening. I tried all I could to resist him, I was losing strength. He was about to drag my underpants down. My eyes went straight to the bottle I drank the soft drink from, I picked it up, I told him I will smash his head if he dares to come close to me again. He retraced instantly and told me to calm down that he would not touch me again. 
            
            I changed back to my trouser; I was still with the bottle, very much ready for his animosity. I decided to sleep on the bare floor with my eyes open, not minding how cold it was. I prayed for the day to break.
            
            He thought I had slept, he came again. I raised the bottle to hit him. He said for the fact I refused him to touch me I should leave his house. I said no problem that I would go.
            
             I left his room. Inside his compound, I was able to see a pavement very close to where they rear chicken and that was where I slept with one eye closed till daybreak. 
              
            As the day broke, I dusted myself, went back to where I came from. Thank God I came with my credit card, wondered what would have happened to me if I had left it.</p>
